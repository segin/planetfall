# Directives

- Only work on one work item at a time! Do not, under any circumstances, batch your work.
- Mark in-progress tasks as in-progress, so that it is clear where you were if interrupted.
- Make a commit and push that commit after each and every completed item. Do not mark the next one as in-progress until after the commit and push are completed.
- Update the current issues to address in this document as you work. Constant updates to this file are required.

# Current issues to address:

- You can enter the escape pod before the explosions open the escape pod door. 
- You do not have enough time to explore the ship before dying. Compare against original game.
- Quit has no confirmation
- Score message is generic and simple.
- Status bar has time and no score.
